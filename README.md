# lahacks2018

Inspiration:
* Inspired by Yelp

What it does:
* In the purpose of building a better community, Trend Finder identifies trendy and hot venues in any city around the world, serving not only as a tool for tourists, but also allowing residents to rediscover and explore their current communities.

How we built it:
* Utilized Node.js and Express.js frameworks

Challenges we ran into:
* Connecting front-end to back-end
* Tying together the Foursquare and Google Map APIs to make comprehensive visuals

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
* Created a nice UI and utilized both Foursquare and Google Maps APIs.
* It was a great team effort and we're proud of each of our members!

What we learned:
* We learned how to create a functional web application

What's next for Trend Finder:
* For the future, we hope to implement an "Event" API that allows users to view/upload public events happening around selected cities, which would further foster a more inclusive environment for everyone in the community.
* Come and find out!
